\title{Perform Cross-Validation on Group Fits of a Model}
\usage{
cross_validated_group_fits(model_name, combined_data, lower, upper)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{A string specifying the name of the model to be
cross-validated.}

\item{combined_data}{A list of combined data conditions used for
cross-validation.}

\item{lower}{Numeric vector of lower bounds for the model's parameters.}

\item{upper}{Numeric vector of upper bounds for the model's parameters.}
}
\value{
A list containing cross-validation results, including fitted
parameters, training accuracy, and a data frame of test results for each
fold.
}
\description{
This function runs cross-validation for group fits of a specified model using
a set of combined data conditions. It supports both standard and stochastic
models and performs fitting for each fold in the cross-validation process.
The function records both the training accuracy and the testing results for
each fold.
