\title{Create Animated Plot of Co-Occurrence Matrix from Training Trials}
\usage{
plot_training_trials(trials, fname = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{trials}{A list representing the training data, where each element is a
trial containing lists of words (\code{words}) and objects (\code{objs}).}

\item{fname}{A string specifying the filename where the animation should be saved.
If left as an empty string (''), no file will be saved.}
}
\value{
A long-format data frame where each row corresponds to a trial and
includes columns for trial number, word, object, and the count of co-occurrences
up to that trial.
}
\description{
This function takes a sequence of training trials, each consisting of words
and objects, and creates an animated plot of the word-object co-occurrence matrix.
The plot evolves over each trial, visually representing the accumulation of
co-occurrences. The animation is saved to a file if a filename is provided.
